<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am a 5th year Ph.D. candidate in Mechanical Engineering at McGill University in Montreal, working at the intersection of artificial intelligence, additive manufacturing, and composites. My research focuses on developing AI-based sensing and decision-making tools to support process monitoring, defect detection, and quality evaluation in advanced manufacturing systems. I am supervised by Dr. Yaoyao Fiona Zhao at Additive Design and Manufacturing Laboratory (ADML).</p>
<p>My PhD research is also supervised by Dr. Guy Lamouche at the Digital Technologies Research Center (DT) of the National Research Council Canada (NRC). At NRC, I have worked with Dr. Priti Wanjara, Dr. Javad Gholipour, Dr. Christophe Bescond, and Dr. Sheida Sarafan as part of the 3+2 Canada-Germany project Artificial Intelligence Enhancement of Process Sensing for Adaptive Laser Additive Manufacturing (AI-SLAM). In AI-SLAM, I have led the research, development and deployment of AI solutions on production machines with close collaboration of industry and research partners (Apollo-Clad Laser Cladding, Fraunhofer Institute for Laser Technology ILT, NRC, Brainware Terz).</p>
<p>In addition to AI-SLAM, I have been part of research collaborations with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Arizona State University (ASU), Nanyang Technological University (NTU), and Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR). These collaborations have broadly explored the applications of transfer learning to expedite the adoption of data-driven additive manufacturing research.</p>
<p>During my Ph.D., I completed a research exchange at the Helmholtz Association of Germany (Forschungszentrum Jülich) in Aachen under the mentorship of Dr. Stefan Sandfeld, Dr. Bashir Kazimi, and Dr. Karina Ruzavev. My research at the Materials Data Science and Informatics (IAS-9) group involved investigation of vision transformer models for segmenting additively manufactured microstructures.</p>
<p>Prior to attending McGill, I was a full-time researcher at the Korea STEP Center in Daejeon. At K-STEP, I developed a PLM-MES interface to link design information with manufacturing instructions and tools for highly customized designs with a case study of ship design data from Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering (DSME).</p>
<p>I completed my M.S. in Mechanical Engineering at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) in Daejeon. My master's research focused on geometric and topological model analysis in inter-CAD model translation. My M.S. thesis on persistent identification for parametric CAD data exchange was advised by Dr. Soonghan Han at the Intelligent Computer-Aided Design (iCAD) group. At iCAD, I was also mentored by Dr. Sooing Kwon.</p>
<p>I completed my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering with honors from the University of Engineering and Technology (UET) in Lahore.</p>
